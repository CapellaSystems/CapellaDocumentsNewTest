## Document Overview

This document provides a walkthrough for the installation and initial testing of Cambria Cluster and Cambria FTC in a Kubernetes environment. The key topics covered include:

1. Overview of the Cambria Cluster / FTC environment in Kubernetes.
2. Creating and configuring the Kubernetes Cluster.
3. Installing Cambria Cluster and Cambria FTC on the Kubernetes Cluster.
4. Verifying the installation.
5. Testing Cambria Cluster / FTC applications.
6. Viewing performance metrics using Prometheus / Grafana.
7. Updating Cambria Cluster / FTC applications on Kubernetes.
8. Deleting a Kubernetes Cluster.
9. Quick reference for Kubernetes installation.
10. Quick reference for important Kubernetes components (URLs, template projects, test players, etc).
11. Glossary of important terms.

## 1. Overview

Capellaâ€™s Cambria Cluster deployment is recommended to run on at least 3 nodes (replica = 3) with a service (Load Balancer) exposing the application externally. Each pod contains the following containers:

- **Cambria Cluster (application):** Core application.
- **Auto-Scale FTC dotnet tool:** Spawns Cambria FTC machines based on the number of queued transcoding jobs. The formula is: `(number of jobs + 2) / 3`.
- **Leader Elector tool:** Selects the main Cambria Cluster pod, with others as backups in case of failure.

Additionally, a PostgreSQL database runs in a separate pod for each Cambria Cluster node, with data replication across pods to preserve data integrity.

Cambria FTC deployments run on separate pods, each containing:

- **Cambria FTC (application):** Core application.
- **Auto-Connect FTC dotnet tool:** Lists pods, finds Cambria Cluster, and connects the FTC application to it. If no cluster is found within ~20 minutes, the node pool is recycled.
- **PostgreSQL:** Database for Cambria FTC application.

Each Kubernetes node runs either the Cluster deployment or the FTC deployment.

## 2. Create Kubernetes Cluster

To create a Kubernetes Cluster on Akamai Cloud, follow these steps:

1. Create a directory to store all setup files. This will be referred to as your `kubernetes` directory.

### Windows:
```bash
mkdir -p C:/Users/<your-username>/kubernetes/Akamai
```

### Linux:
```bash
mkdir -p /home/<your-username>/kubernetes/Akamai
